# Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a full data analytics workflow, including data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL queries, dashboard creation, reporting, and presentation. The goal is to extract actionable insights and present them in a clear, visual format.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Public dataset (CSV/Excel or SQL database)
- **Description:** Contains relevant features for analysis such as sales, transactions, or customer data.
- **Format:** CSV, Excel, or SQL database

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and visualization
- **SQL** – Queries on MySQL
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation
- **Gamma** – Professional presentation creation
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment

## Workflow
1. **Load Data**  
   - Import dataset into Python using Pandas  
   - Preview data and check for missing or inconsistent values  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summary statistics and distributions  
   - Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, correlation matrices)  
   - Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies  

3. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing or null values  
   - Correct data types and formats  
   - Remove duplicates and outliers  

4. **SQL Analysis**  
   - Load data into MySQL 
   - Perform queries for aggregation and summarization  
   - Extract key insights for analysis  

5. **Dashboard & Visualization**  
   - Build interactive Power BI dashboard  
   - Include charts, KPIs, and filters for business insights  

6. **Reporting**  
   - Document methodology, analysis, and key insights  
   - Include visualizations and tables for clarity  

7. **Presentation**  
   - Create a professional slide deck in Gamma  
   - Summarize insights and recommendations for stakeholders  

## Dashboard
- Interactive charts and filters for easy exploration  
- Highlights key metrics, trends, and actionable insights  
- Designed for business stakeholders to make data-driven decisions  

## Results / Insights
- Key trends and patterns identified in the dataset  
- Insights presented visually to support business decisions  
- Recommendations based on data analysis
